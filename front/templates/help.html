        <h2>Car mode 🏎️</h2>
        <p>
            You can select different car modes to control your car.
        </p>

        <h4>Training 🏋️</h4>
        <p>
            This mode lets you control your car using your laptop keyboard. While you drive your car, it will save labelled pictures locally so that you can generate a dataset of your circuit.
        </p>

        <h4>Autopilot</h4>
        <p>
            To enable autopilot, you will need to select and load a model on your Raspberry Pi. Once the model is loaded, you can start your car and it will drive by itself !
        </p>

        <h4>Direction auto 💡</h4>
        <p>
            Use this mode to control automatically the steering of the car. You can use the keyboard to control the acceleration of your car.
        </p>

        <h4>Rest 💤</h4>
        <p>
            Stops the car.
        </p>

        <h2>Speed mode ⚡</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on the car mode, you will have the ability to chose a speed mode for your car, giving you more control on it. Whichever speed mode you select, you will always have the ability to choose the
            max speed limit.
        </p>

        <h4>Constant ➡️</h4>
        <p>
            Your car will drive at a constant speed.
        </p>

        <h4>Auto</h4>
        <p>
            This mode will adjust the speed depending on the confidence of the car on its prediction. The more confident a prediction is, the faster it will go.
            If the model is not confident at all (the prediction has a low score), then, the car will be slow.
